This repository contains a proposed extension to the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines.

The proposed extension concerns Givens rotations. A rotation can be applied to two vectors using `rot`, but this is a level 1 BLAS operation and therefore its potential for efficient implementations is limited. The proposed extension add `rotc`, which applies a chain of sequences of rotations to a matrix. This is a level 3 BLAS operation and can be implemented efficiently on modern hardware, as demonstrated in our paper [1] and by the implementation in this repository.
